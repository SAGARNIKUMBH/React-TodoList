        The Value of Personal Statements Have you considered the full value your
        Personal Statement adds to strengthen your overall medical residency
        application? Some residency applicants are not aware of the many roles a
        Personal Statement plays in the residency application process from
        interview selection to Rank Order Lists. The Medical Residency Personal
        Statement can boost a weak application past residency program filters,
        secure an interview, provide content for program interview questions,
        and even help Program Directors make the final selections for their Rank
        Order List. A well-crafted Personal Statement is crucial to help you
        stand out from the thousands of other applicants contending for limited
        residency program positions. Residency Statement will provide you with
        the Personal Statement you need to guide you along your ERAS Residency
        Application journey with strength and confidence.
